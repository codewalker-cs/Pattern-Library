# 📚 Pattern Library

A personal handbook of algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

This repository is not just solutions — it is a growing library of **patterns** used in data structures, algorithms, and interview problems.  
Each folder represents a reusable technique that appears across many problems.

The goal: recognize patterns instantly and apply them with confidence and to understand them deeply.

## 🎯 Purpose

Instead of memorizing individual problems, this repo focuses on:

- learning reusable algorithmic techniques
- understanding when to apply them
- building intuition through repetition
- keeping templates for fast recall
- tracking mistakes and insights

This acts as a long-term revision guide and interview reference.

## 📂 Structure

Each pattern folder contains:
Technique Name/
├── theory.md     → explanation of the pattern <br>
├── template.cpp  → reusable code skeleton<br>
├── problems.md   → list of solved problems + notes<br>
